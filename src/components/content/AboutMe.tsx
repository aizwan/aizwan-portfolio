        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>{siteConfig.author}</strong>, a dedicated and versatile full-stack developer with a strong background in designing and building user-focused, scalable web applications. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills across the full development lifecycle, from front-end interfaces to back-end systems, ensuring seamless integration and top-notch performance.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        On the front end, I excel in creating responsive and engaging user interfaces using modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue.js. I prioritize clean code, intuitive design, and a smooth user experience. For the back end, I leverage tools such as Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL to craft robust and efficient server-side solutions. Iâ€™m also experienced with caching strategies using Redis to optimize performance and scalability.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        As a freelance programmer, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with diverse clients, building everything from e-commerce platforms to custom property apps. Each project has taught me the importance of collaboration, clear communication, and delivering solutions that align with the clientâ€™s goals.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        Beyond development, I have a deep interest in exploring innovative technologies, troubleshooting complex problems, and continuously improving my craft. My goal is always to create impactful digital experiences that solve real-world challenges.
